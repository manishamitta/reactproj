It can be collapsed to save space on the screen.\n *\n * ### Guidelines:\n *\n * - Nesting two or more panels is not recommended.\n * - Do not stack too many panels on one page.\n *\n * ### Structure\n * The panel's header area consists of a title bar with a header text or custom header.\n *\n * The header is clickable and can be used to toggle between the expanded and collapsed state. It includes an icon which rotates depending on the state.\n *\n * The custom header can be set through the `header` slot and it may contain arbitraray content, such as: title, buttons or any other HTML elements.\n *\n * The content area can contain an arbitrary set of controls.\n *\n * **Note:** The custom header is not clickable out of the box, but in this case the icon is interactive and allows to show/hide the content area.\n *\n * ### Responsive Behavior\n *\n * - If the width of the panel is set to 100% (default), the panel and its children are\n * resized responsively,\n * depending on its parent container.\n * - If the panel has a fixed height, it will take up the space even if the panel is\n * collapsed.\n * - When the panel is expandable (the `fixed` property is set to `false`),\n * an arrow icon (pointing to the right) appears in front of the header.\n * - When the animation is activated, expand/collapse uses a smooth animation to open or\n * close the content area.\n * - When the panel expands/collapses, the arrow icon rotates 90 degrees\n * clockwise/counter-clockwise.\n *\n * ### Keyboard Handling\n *\n * #### Fast Navigation\n * This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via [F6] / [Shift] + [F6] / [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] / [Down] or [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] + [Up].\n * In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module:\n * `import \"@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js\"`\n *\n *\n *\n * __Note__: This is a UI5 Web Component!
