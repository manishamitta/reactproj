It can hold any type of HTML elements.\n * It's defined by using the `WizardStep` as slotted element within the `Wizard`.\n *\n * ### Scrolling\n * The component handles user scrolling by selecting the closest step, based on the current scroll position\n * and scrolls to particular place, when the user clicks on the step within the navigation area.\n *\n * **Important:** In order the component's scrolling behaviour to work, it has to be limited from the outside parent element in terms of height.\n * The component or its parent has to be given percentage or absolute height. Otherwise, the component will be scrolled out with the entire page.\n *\n * **For example:**\n *\n * ```html\n * <ui5-dialog style=\"height: 80%\">\n * \t<Wizard></Wizard>\n * </ui5-dialog>\n * ```\n *\n * #### Moving to next step\n * The `WizardStep` provides the necessary API and it's up to the user of the component to use it to move to the next step.\n * You have to set its `selected` property (and remove the `disabled` one if set) to `true`.\n * The `Wizard` will automatically scroll to the content of the newly selected step.\n *\n * The Fiori 3 guidelines recommends having a \"nextStep\" button in the content area.\n * You can place a button, or any other type of element to trigger step change, inside the `WizardStep`,\n * and show/hide it when certain fields are filled or user defined criteria is met.\n *\n * ### Usage\n * #### When to use:\n * When the user has to accomplish a long or unfamiliar task.\n *\n * #### When not to use:\n * When the task has less than 3 steps.\n *\n * ### Responsive Behavior\n * On small widths the step's titleText, subtitleText and separators in the navigation area shrink and from particular point the steps are grouped together and overlap.\n * Tapping on them will show a popover to select the step to navigate to. On mobile device, the grouped steps are presented within a dialog.\n *\n *  (includes <ui5-wizard-step/>)\n *\n * __Note__: This is a UI5 Web Component!
