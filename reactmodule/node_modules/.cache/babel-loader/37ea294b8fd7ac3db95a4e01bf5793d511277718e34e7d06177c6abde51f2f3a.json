The displayed content changes based on the current mode of the `DynamicPageHeader`.\n * - `DynamicPageHeader` - a generic container, which can contain a single layout component and any other HTML elements. The header works in two modes - expanded and snapped and its behavior can be adjusted with the help of different properties.\n * - `Content area` - a generic container, which can have a single UI5 layout.\n * - `Footer` - positioned at the bottom with a small offset and used for additional actions, the footer floats above the content.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * Use the `DynamicPage` if you need to have a title, that is always visible\n * and a header, that has configurable Expanding/Snapping functionality.\n * If you don't need the Expanding/Snapping functionality it is better to use the\n * `Page` as a lighter component.\n *\n * The app can add to the `default` slot of the ui5-dynamic-page either content that is designed to fit its container (e.g. has 100% height),\n * or content with own height that may overflow its container. In the second case the `DynamicPage` will show a scrollbar that allows the user\n * scroll through the content.\n *\n * ## Notes:\n *\n * - Snapping of the `DynamicPageTitle` is not supported in the following case:\n *  - When the `DynamicPage` has a scroll bar, the component usually scrolls to the snapping point - the point, where the `DynamicPageHeader` is scrolled out completely. However, when there is a scroll bar, but not enough content to reach the snapping point, the snapping is not possible using scrolling.\n *\n * ### Responsive Behavior\n *\n * Dynamic page web component implements the responsive paddings design.\n *\n * ### Keyboard Handling\n *\n *\n * ### Basic Navigation\n *\n * - [SPACE, ENTER, RETURN] - If focus is on a button inside DynamicPageTitle its action is being triggered, once activated.\n * If focus is on the snap header button (arrow button), or on the header itself, once activated, it triggers the associated action (such as snap/expand the header).\n * If focus is on pin button (the button with pin icon on the bottom of the header), once activated, it triggers the associated action (pinning of the header).\n *\n * ### Fast Navigation\n * - This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via `F6 / Shift + F6` or ` Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Down /  Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Up`.\n * In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module:\n *\n * - `import \"@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js\"`\n *\n *\n *\n * __Note__: This is a UI5 Web Component!
