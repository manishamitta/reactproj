The value property of each `CalendarDate` must be a\n * date string, correctly formatted according to the `Calendar`'s `formatPattern` property.\n * Whenever the user changes the date selection, `Calendar` will automatically create/remove instances\n * of `CalendarDate` in itself, unless you prevent this behavior by calling `preventDefault()` for the\n * `selection-change` event. This is useful if you want to control the selected dates externally.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * The user can navigate to a particular date by:\n *\n * - Pressing over a month inside the months view\n * - Pressing over an year inside the years view\n *\n * The user can confirm a date selection by pressing over a date inside the days view.\n *\n * ### Keyboard Handling\n * The `Calendar` provides advanced keyboard handling.\n * When a picker is showed and focused the user can use the following keyboard\n * shortcuts in order to perform a navigation:\n *\n * - Day picker:\n *\n * - [F4] - Shows month picker\n * - [Shift] + [F4] - Shows year picker\n * - [Page Up] - Navigate to the previous month\n * - [Page Down] - Navigate to the next month\n * - [Shift] + [Page Up] - Navigate to the previous year\n * - [Shift] + [Page Down] - Navigate to the next year\n * - [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [Page Up] - Navigate ten years backwards\n * - [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [Page Down] - Navigate ten years forwards\n * - [Home] - Navigate to the first day of the week\n * - [End] - Navigate to the last day of the week\n * - [Ctrl] + [Home] - Navigate to the first day of the month\n * - [Ctrl] + [End] - Navigate to the last day of the month\n *\n * - Month picker:\n *\n * - [Page Up] - Navigate to the previous year\n * - [Page Down] - Navigate to the next year\n * - [Home] - Navigate to the first month of the current row\n * - [End] - Navigate to the last month of the current row\n * - [Ctrl] + [Home] - Navigate to the first month of the current year\n * - [Ctrl] + [End] - Navigate to the last month of the year\n *\n * - Year picker:\n *\n * - [Page Up] - Navigate to the previous year range\n * - [Page Down] - Navigate the next year range\n * - [Home] - Navigate to the first year of the current row\n * - [End] - Navigate to the last year of the current row\n * - [Ctrl] + [Home] - Navigate to the first year of the current year range\n * - [Ctrl] + [End] - Navigate to the last year of the current year range\n *\n * #### Fast Navigation\n * This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via [F6] / [Shift] + [F6] / [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] / [Down] or [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] + [Up].\n * In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module:\n * `import \"@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js\"`\n *\n * ### Calendar types\n * The component supports several calendar types - Gregorian, Buddhist, Islamic, Japanese and Persian.\n * By default the Gregorian Calendar is used.
